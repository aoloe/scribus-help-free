the best rule to get good tables is to avoid them...

this is imo a general rule...

in scribus this is even more true. due to the not so perfect support for tables.

the second rule -- that only concerns scribus -- is to import the table as png, pdf or svg from libreoffice.

and if you really want to do table, in 1.4.x alt-click allows you to select a single cell. you will then find in the properties palette a specific set of checkboxes in the line tab of the properties palette to set each border individually.

the same alt key should be used for typing text in a cell. alt-double click on it...




Use a text frame with tab stops and draw lines on top of it, create table in another program and insert into Scribus as image (preferably vector image like EPS, SVG or PDF) etc. (peter nermander)
