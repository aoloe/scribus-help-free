the best rule to get good tables is to avoid them...

this is imo a general rule...

in scribus this is even more true. due to the not so perfect support for tables.

the second rule -- that only concerns scribus -- is to import the table as png, pdf or svg from libreoffice.

and if you really want to do table, alt-click allows you to select a single cell. you will then find in the properties palette a way to set each border individually. it should be in the table or colors tab.
