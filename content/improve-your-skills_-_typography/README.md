## Notes

- Usually body text should between 10 and 12 points, but not all fonts look as large at a given font size.
- Align the text to the baseline or use a fixed line height.
- Line spacing should be between 120% and 150% of the body text. 150% being too wide in most cases.
- The avarage line length should be of 45 to 90 characters. Define the columns number and width and the margin according to it.
- Avoid the system fonts (like Times New Roman or Arial) but don't be too exhotic either. Most of the time, Comic Sans is not Ok.
- Hyphenate your text. For manual hyphenation use the smart hyphen and not the `-` character.
- Always hyphenate justified text. Avoid it for left aligend text.
- Don't underline. Prefer italics to bold in the body text. Except if your graphical concept requires it.
- All caps (and small caps) should , but not be used for longer parts of text. They should get 5% to 12% extra letter spacing.
- Avoid centered text.
- Don't use both an indent at the beginning of the paragraph and an extra space above it. Both should not be too large.
- If your language requires a space before punctuation (:, ?, ...) use a non breaking space.
- Don't use spaces for aligning columns: use tabulators for it
- Prefer lists with tabulators to tables
- Use the typographic quotes that match your language standard.
- Use the n-dash for parenthetical statements.

Style:

- Avoid exclamation and question marks in the titles. Use exclamation marks very sparesely in the body text.
