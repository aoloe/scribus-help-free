## Ale on scribus/forum

There are both practical and theoretical reason for not directly print from Scribus

On the one side, printing is a difficult job and you have to deal with many differences both on the side of the OS (linux, bsd, os x, windows, os 2, haiku...), the printer drivers and the printer.  
i believe that a specialized tool like a pdf viewer will always do a better job. trying to manage the printing from scribus only diverts from the real goal of scribus: letting the user creat amazing layouts!

On the theoretical side, from the beginning scribus has chosen to target PDFs. it'a software geared towards the creation of a PDF to be sent to a print shop and get professionally printed.  
If you use a different subset to print to your home printer before you send your job to the print shop, you might get a wrong preview!
Being forced to produce a PDF, display it on your monitor and then print it, might help you catch some glitches, since your feeding your home printer with the same data you will send to the print shop.

But, maybe, one day Scribus will have a reliable a "print command" that creates a PDF in the background and then launches your preferred PDF viewer and print it.

At the end of the day, the unreliable print function is more annoying than a real deal breaker.
