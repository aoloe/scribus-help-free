there are reasons, both practical and theoretical, that have lead me to push for the opposite way of doing: scribus should not be able to *directly* print at all!

why?

on the one side, printing is a difficult job and you have to deal with many differences both on the side of the OS (linux, bsd, os x, windows, os 2, haiku...), the printer drivers and the printer.
i believe that a specialized tool like a pdf viewerwill always do a better job. trying to manage the printing from scribus only diverts from the real goal of scribus: letting the user creating amazing layouts!

on the theoretical side, from the beginning scribus has chosen to target PDFs. it'a software geared towards creation of a PDF to be sent to a print shop and get professionally printed.
if you use a different subset to print to your home printer before you send your job to the print shop, you might get a wrong preview!
being forced to produce a PDF, display on your monitor and then print it, might help you catch some glitches, since your feeding your home printer with the same data you will send to the print shop.

and for the lazy guys among us, i personally, would prefer a "print command" that creates a PDF in the background and then launches your preferred PDF viewer and print it... but since on some systems the print function does indeed work as intended, the team sticks with the current situation.
and lets us explain all this to the many people that are deceived by scribus not being able to print...
