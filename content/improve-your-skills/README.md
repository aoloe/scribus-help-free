# Improve your skills

This chapter contains hints on how to get better with Scribus. It should be a short of FAQ, that just list topics, a very short description and, then a link to the place where the user can learn the details.

It would be nice if each item would have a screenshot or an animated gif.

## Getting faster

- learn the shortcuts by looking at the menues
- ctrl-zoom + ctrl-- and ctr-+
- t, i, and s to add text frames, images and shapes
- use guides
- shift-click to insert a frame that fills the area delimited by margins and guides
- type formulas in the measurement fields

## Be accurate

- rather than resizing with the mouse you can type exact measurements in the properties palette
- you can move frames with the arrows on the keyboard. the shift key allows you to be more precise
- you can resize with the keyboard. hold down the alt key and use the arrows. alt + shift resizes in the opposite direction.
- use guides.
- if you want items to be at the same place on each page, add guides to the master page.

## Work with others

- what is important for the text sources? (odt, html, txt)
- for the image sources?
- for the pdf export?
