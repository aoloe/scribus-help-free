# Contributing to this help files

This document explains how to contribute to this repository of help files. It's rather long and you don't have to read all of this before starting your work: you will automatically follow most of them, if you pick up a file and start modifying it.  
Consider this as the place you will go to, if you wonder how to do something.

Just one thing: if you have never contributed to projects on Github, you should probably read the "How to get your content in here" section below.

## Table of contents

- How to get your content in here
- Which markdown commands are ok?
- Files, directories, and languages
- Language and content style guide
- Images and screenshots
- How to discuss the content



## How to get your content in here

TBC

- register
- fork
- branch
- edit
- pull request for each change
- after the pull request don't edit the branch anymore and create a new one for the next changes.

## Which markdown commands are ok?

TBD

## Files, directories, and languages

TBD

Each directory contains all the files used to display the help page in the different languages

### The directories

- a flat structure of directories.
- the directories are named after the english title of the page, all lowercase, with dashes (`-`) replacing the spaces, without any special characters (only a-z are allowed).
- subdirectories use `_-_` as separator (like in `community_-_getting-help`). the directories structure is flat, and the subchapters are not subdirectories of the chapters.

### The help files


### Multiple languages

- english is the default language
- translations are post fixed with a 5 letters language code (`this-page.de_DE.md`)
- images also can have a language code.


## Language and content style guide

TBC

- a language style guide per language
- we should try to stick to providing help on how to use Scribus and, where it's possible, avoid to disgress and start teaching the user the good habits in DTP (those should be in a separate manual...).

## Images and screenshots

- if Qt supports it, we should use animaged GIFs to improve the explainations (and keep them short). Cf. the Inkscape manual.
- Here some comments on how the Inkscape guys are creating their GIF-screencast:
  - <http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/CreatingScreencasts>
  - <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.graphics.inkscape.devel/44774>
- [gimp and animated gifs](http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Simple_Animations/)

### The README files

- each directory can -- and probably should -- have a `README.md` file with notes on the help page.

# Screenshots

- If possible the screenshot should not show the OS / window manager used when it has been taken
- Remove the OS decoration and add a gray border `#6a6864` (was `#b9b5b2`)
