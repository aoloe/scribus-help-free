# Contributing to this help files

This document explains how to contribute to this repository of help files. It's rather long and you don't have to read all of this before starting your work: you will automatically follow most of them, if you pick up a file and start modifying it.  
Consider this as the place you will go to, if you wonder how to do something.

Just one thing: if you have never contributed to projects on Github, you should probably read the "How to get your content in here" section below.

## Table of contents

## Files and directories

TBD

### The directories

- a flat structure of directories.
- the directories are named after the english title of the page, all lowercase, with dashes (`-`) replacing the spaces, without any special characters (only a-z are allowed).
- subdirectories use `_-_` as separator (like in `community_-_getting-help`). the directories structure is flat, and the subchapters are not subdirectories of the chapters.
